    Definition of an Investor
</h2>
<p>
    An investor is an individual or entity that puts money into a business venture with the expectation of making a profit. Investors can be individuals, businesses, or organizations that are looking to make a return on their investment. Entrepreneurs often seek out investors to help fund their business ventures, as they may not have the necessary capital to get started. Investors typically provide capital in exchange for equity in the business, meaning they will own a portion of the company.
</p>
<p>Investors can provide a variety of resources to entrepreneurs, including capital, advice, and connections. Capital is the most obvious resource, as it allows entrepreneurs to purchase the necessary resources to get their business off the ground. Advice from investors can be invaluable, as they often have experience in the industry and can provide guidance on how to best manage the business. Finally, investors can provide entrepreneurs with connections to potential customers, suppliers, and other entrepreneurs.

Investors can be a great asset to entrepreneurs, as they can provide the necessary resources to get a business off the ground. However, it is important to remember that investors are looking to make a return on their investment, so entrepreneurs should be prepared to give up a portion of their business in exchange for the capital they provide.
